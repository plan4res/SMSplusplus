#   makefile of libSMS++ as a pre-built library                              #
#                                                                            #
#   This makefile is thought to be included by the makefile of some code     #
#   using the libSMS++ library. However, this makefile treats libSMS++ as    #
#   a pre-built library, in the sense that it ensures that it is built (by   #
#   a separate make process) and then returns as $(SMS++OBJ) the complete    #
#   libSMS++ library together with macros $(SMS++INC) and $(SMS++LIB) for    #
#   includes and external libraries, but not $(SMS++H).                      #
#                                                                            #
#   Input:  $(SMS++SDR) = the directory where the core SMS++ source is       #
#                                                                            #
#   Output: there is no $(SMS++H) output, since the calling makefile has     #
#           no need to check for changes in the .h and rebuild the .a: this  #
#           is all done here inside. However, the following macros are       #
#           provided because the code using libSMS++ need to know where to   #
#           find the .h files to include, which external libraries and       #
#            -L< libdirs > need be used in the linking phase, and of course  #
#           libSMS++.a need be linked against.                               #
#           $(SMS++INC) = the -I$( include directories ) for SMS++           #
#           $(SMS++LIB) = external libreries + -L< libdirs > for SMS++       #
#           $(SMS++OBJ) = the libSMS++ library itself                        #
#                                                                            #
#   Internally, the makefile calls makefile-c, strips away the *H macro and  #
#   redefines the *OBJ one.                                                  #
#                                                                            #
