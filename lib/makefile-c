#   complete makefile of the core SMS++                                      #
#                                                                            #
#   The makefile defines internally all external libraries required by       #
#   the core SMS++ library. Accordingly, all necessary OBJ, H, -I            #
#   directives, and external libraries + -L< libdirs > are added to the      #
#   corresponding SMS++* macros.                                             #
#                                                                            #
#   Note that the core SMS++ is never thought to be compiled in isolation,   #
#   but rather to be just one (albeit central) component of a more complex   #
#   project comprising other repos. The makefiles dealing with the external  #
#   libraries are all thought to be bunched into the extlib/ folder of the   #
#   "outer" project (say, the SMS++ umbrella one), i.e., in                  #
#   $(SMS++SDR)/../extlib/ (one level above the core SMS++ directory).       #
#                                                                            #

#   Output: $(SMS++OBJ) = the final objects                                  #
#           $(SMS++H)   = the .h files to include for the core SMS++         #
#           $(SMS++INC) = all the -I$( include dirs ) of the core SMS++      #
